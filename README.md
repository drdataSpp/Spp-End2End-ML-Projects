# END TO END MACHINE LEARNING PROJECTS
*AI Web-App built using Flask Framework*

## Project 1: Diabetic Predictor
[Project 1 Link](https://github.com/drdataSpp/ML-App1-Diabetes-Predictor)

**Project description:** This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.

**Solution:** A HTML form captures all the data about the patient and sends it to the machine learning classification algorithm running in the backend to predict the outcome.

**Tools Used:** HTML, CSS, Python for Machine Learning and Flask Framework.

## Project 2: Loan Approval Predictor
[Project 2 Link](https://github.com/drdataSpp/ML-App2-Loan-Approval-Predictor)

**Project description:** Finance companies deals with some kinds of home loans. They may have their presence across urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first applies for home loan and after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan. Mostly Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others.

**Solution:** To automate the loan approval process, I have created a HTML form that captures all the data about the loan applicant and sends it to the machine learning classification algorithm running in the backend to predict the outcome.

**Tools Used:** HTML, CSS, Python for Machine Learning and Flask Framework.

## Project 3: Helping Farmers to Determine Crop
[Project 3 Link](https://github.com/drdataSpp/ML-App3-Crop-Determining-AI-App)

**Project description:** Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. It helps the farmers to get informed decision about the farming strategy. This projects allows me to build a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.

**Solution:** To automate the loan approval process, I have created a HTML form that captures all the data about the loan applicant and sends it to the machine learning classification algorithm running in the backend to predict the outcome.

**Tools Used:** HTML, CSS, Python for Machine Learning and Flask Framework.

## Project 4: Drug Recommender AI App
[Project 4 Link](https://github.com/drdataSpp/ML-App4-Drug-Recommender-AI-App)

**Project description:** Imagine that you are a medical researcher compiling data for a study. You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y. Part of your job is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The features of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and the Cholesterol of the patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to. It is a sample of multiclass classifier, and you can use the training part of the dataset to build a decision tree, and then use it to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to prescribe a drug to a new patient.

**Solution:** To automate the loan approval process, I have created a HTML form that captures all the data about the loan applicant and sends it to the machine learning classification algorithm running in the backend to predict the outcome.

**Tools Used:** HTML, CSS, Python for Machine Learning and Flask Framework.

## Project 5: Vehicle Insurance Response Predictor AI App
[Project 5 Link](https://github.com/drdataSpp/ML-App5-Insurance-Response-Predictor-AI-App)

**Project description:** Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue. Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.

**Solution:** To automate the loan approval process, I have created a HTML form that captures all the data about the loan applicant and sends it to the machine learning classification algorithm running in the backend to predict the outcome.

**Tools Used:** HTML, CSS, Python for Machine Learning and Flask Framework.
